GOLDEN FARM — the money regression.

Fixed inputs to a fixed P&L, asserted to the dollar. If a change moves the farmer's numbers,
this fails and someone has to say why. That is the whole point: the rest of the suite pins
STRUCTURE (test_accounting) and the solver in isolation (test_solver), but nothing pinned the
number a user actually sees, so every money defect found so far was caught by review or by
hand rather than by CI.

Two properties make this different from test_regression.py:

  1. It runs the app's REAL default payload, captured from the browser
     (tests/golden/default_farm_payload.json) — the ~80-acre demo farm, not a synthetic
     fixture. What it pins is what the landing screen claims.

  2. It runs through run_from_js, the Python adapter embedded in public/index.html, not
     solve_farm_v2 directly. The adapter is money-path code in its own right: it nets
     variable selling cost into price, derives cash_constraint_enabled, and deducts channel
     fixed selling from the reported profit. Calling the solver directly would skip all of
     that and pin a number no user ever sees.

WHEN THIS FAILS: do not just re-pin it. Work out which line moved and whether the new number
is more honest than the old one. Several known-open defects (water priced at zero, labor
double-counted, the margin hurdle running on phantom rates) will each move these figures when
fixed — that is expected, and the new values should be recorded here with a note saying why.

# Baseline history — re-pin ONLY with a reason, and record it here.
#   2026-07-27 (first pin): fixed 341,812 / profit 443,458.
#   2026-07-27 (re-pinned): the water-tank capital benchmark was $3.74/L, which made the
#     stock 270,000 L tank a $1,009,800 asset and 15% of ALL fixed cost on an 80-acre farm.
#     Re-benchmarked to $0.50/L installed: a 10,000-gal poly tank lists around $13,940
#     ($0.37/L) before freight, and per-litre cost falls with capacity. Fixed cost
#     341,812 -> 298,072 (-43,740) and profit 443,458 -> 487,549. Revenue, variable cost and
#     overhead are UNCHANGED — the plan did not move, only the cost of a tank did.
#     (Retiring operating_weeks as a cost multiplier in the same commit changed nothing here,
#     because the shipped default was already 52.)
#   2026-07-27 (re-captured): the previous fixture had been captured AFTER the JS margin hurdle
#     mutated the payload — Spinach/Wholesale went in with weekly_demand_lbs = 0, so the golden
#     farm was pinning a post-hurdle plan rather than the form's own defaults. With the hurdle
#     moved into Python and defaulted OFF (SPEC_v3 §8), the payload is now the untouched
#     defaults: that channel's 25,000 lb/wk cap is back, revenue 1,793,298 -> 1,815,018 and
#     profit 487,549 -> 494,134. Lesson worth keeping: capture the fixture from the FORM, not
#     from a payload something upstream has already rewritten.

# $50 is the solver noise floor, not a comfort margin. The MILP is solved by HiGHS via scipy,
# and different builds (notably Pyodide's vs a local venv) settle on solutions that differ by
# a couple of dollars on a $443k plan — the browser reports $443,460 where this path reports
# $443,458. Pinning to the literal dollar would make the test fail on a scipy upgrade and
# teach everyone to re-pin reflexively, which is exactly the habit that makes a money guard
# worthless. $50 is 0.011% of profit, while every real defect found in this codebase moved
# $10k-$171k, so nothing that matters can hide under it.
